# Mini-Java Compiler

This is a compiler for the Mini-Java language, which is a (proper) subset of Java. Its grammar, conveniently written in a syntax similar to the one used by Yacc, may be found [here](grammar/lr1.txt). The design and development of this compiler constitued the main assignment of the DIM0611 - COMPILADORES (compilers) class, in the 2019.1 semester.
